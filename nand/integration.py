        are ordered as if one such reference (chosen in no particular way) was removed.

        be evaluated later as well. MemorySystem and the components supplying its `address` input
        are included in the main sequence, but its other inputs can appear later.

        The desired result is:
        - minimal "back-edges", where an output of a later component feeds an input of an earlier one
        - a back-edge whose source is definitely latched is ok (DFF/Register.out); these signals
