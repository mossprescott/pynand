"""A low-level, precise evaluator, which can simulate _any_ IC based on Nand gates, as well as any
custom component which can express its behavior in terms of updating bits in a state vector.

This is fast enough for small tests, about 1 kHz, but not fast enough to run large interactive
programs.

This simulation allows all the components of the Nand2Tetris course to be designed and tested,
without relying on any pre-defined components. However, very large chips such as large RAMs
constructed from Nands or even DFFs are too slow to simulate directly, so predefined ROM and RAM
components are provided instead for use in the full CPU/Computer.

Getting this level of performance out of such a low-level simulation, in Python, is a bit of a feat,
so there's a lot of low-level bit slicing tricks being employed here. Compare with the much simpler,
faster, but more limited simulator in codegen.py.
