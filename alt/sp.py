"""An alternative CPU which is backward compatible with the Nand to Tetris design, adding a handful of
new instructions which reduce most interactions with the stack to a single instructions/cycle.

The cost is adding a fourth register to hold SP, and a fair amount of additional logic to decode 2 more
instruction formats (give or take), and to wrangle two more possible sources for the address to memory.

The VM translator is specialized to use the new instructions for push and pop operations, and to take
advantage of them not overwriting the A register.

The result is significant, but not quite mind-blowing:
- gates: about 1,800 (+40% from 1,262), but could probably be improved
- instruction count for Pong: 15.7k (-47% from 29.5k)
- cycles in Sys.init: 2.61m (-34% from 3.97m)

It's also a bit slower per cycle in simulation, resulting in approx. the same net performance
(10s to init.)

Caveat: this design is probably not realistic in that the CPU may supply any of three addresses to
the RAM (A, SP, or SP-1), based on instruction decoding, and then the RAM is read in the same cycle.
In the real world, you would probably need to have the address available at the start of the cycle in
order for the RAM to be read in time. The original design does have that property, because the address
is _always_ A (from the previous cycle). That could be put right by pipelining the processor so that
instruction decoding is one cycle ahead of execution. Of course, there would be more registers (or at
least more state to save,) and probably a one-cycle penalty on taken branches.

There is a temptation to add a few more instruction types, which would further complicate decoding but
not require any new state:
- immediate loads and stores (e.g. A=@LCL, @LCL=A), for frame save/restore and access to temps
- load constant to D, to save an instruction and also avoid clobbering A in some cases.
See notes in Translator below on some places these would help.
