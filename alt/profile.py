"""VM-level profiler, tracking the number of cycles by: instruction, opcode, function.

This immediately revealed that Math.divide is a huge problem, and in particular dividing by 16. So
I added the shift.py implementation which eliminates those calls, for the biggest improvement yet.

Second discovery: 67% of the time (post-initialization) was in Sys.wait(). That was easy to hack
around.

Now:
40% of the time (initialization) is in Memory.alloc(), which is unexpected.
20% is still in Math.multiply, even after making it a bit quicker with "shiftr".
2% is Math.abs, but despite the small number I wonder how much it would help to inline it since it
would be quite simple to translate directly to assembly.

"call" and "return" ops only account for about 5% each. A lot less than expected.
"lt" and "push local" are higher: around 13%. "lt" could be improved a lot in the translator by
fusing it with "not/if-goto".
