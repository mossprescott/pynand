# Note: there is one additional required feature of the MemorySystem, compared to
# the original design according to From Nand To Tetris.
#
# When a value is written to the memory at address 0x6000, the value is stored in
# a special Output component, from which it can be accessed from the "outside".
# Together with the previously expected behavior when *reading* from that address,
# this makes it simple to hook a Computer up to something that looks like a terminal
# with both input (i.e the keyboard) and output (i.e. the "print" head.)
#
# If you want to think of the computer as small PC from the 80s, you can imagine
# that it provides a serial port to connect to a TTY. You would be really happy to
# have that if it was your job to debug the OS code for writing to the screen (and it
# will be â€” see project 12.)

# Note: there are a couple of required outputs for Computer, which aren't seen in
# the original design according to From Nand To Tetris.
#
# Fundamentally these are required just because of the way our simulators work;
# basically there has to be some output from each component or it will be
# "optimized" away when the chip is synthesized.
#
# "pc" is just the output from the CPU, and is sometimes useful for testing.
# "tty_ready" is the output from the MemorySystem, and it's not really useful
#    but it's the only available output so there you go.
